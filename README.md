An aspiring data science and auotmation enthusiast student with astute problem solving 🔍📊 and coding skills 💻. Comes with work experiences in companies and organizations across various roles such as data engineering in Oracle and MySQL databases, ETL across data-warehouses, data analysis and visualization, cloud-based application development,unit test automation, cloud flow automation, web-scraping, SEO, machine learning, artificial intelligence and much more. Years of preseverance and meticuluous dedication have helped to finesse various coding langauages that include Python, R, Java, C, C++, C#, SQL,PLSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Asssembly Language, X++. Furthermore, keeping up with the latest technological developments and philosophy of superintelligence elicits a self-interest and love to work in personal projects that involves various data science tools such as a Sklearn, SciKit, Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Pandas, Dash Plotly, Seaborn etc. It is with great pleasure to earn skill certifications under this field from Google, Udemy, Coursera and much more.

Loves inculcating experiences from outside and inside the realms of academic institution, and have succesfully collaborated on research design project involving the creation of a progressive web application that does MRI Brain Tumor scan using advanced Deep Learning techniques and taking inspirations from state-of-the-art Transfer Learning models with advanced image processing method that aims to optimize computational processing and effeciency of memory allocation. Further collaborations involve organizational background in companies that had successfully helped to garner the notion of business models and identifying company KPI trends. Working as an Internal Audit Data Analyst intern for two months in Emirates Group had given this a clearer edification with tasks that involved raw data preprocessing, advanced PLSQL techniques under Oracle, usage of ETL softwares and visualizations that highlight objective trends. Also encouraged to create a self-made protocol audit console model that faciliates easier implementation of minor data queries and making fluidity of data extraction more smoother with Python language and hard coded DASH Plotly web app. On working as an Application team intern with Barakat Group had helped to further gain experience in disciplines outside the scope of theory learnt in academics. Conducting a myriad of unit tests for financial and supply chain operations across cloud-based appplication platform Microsoft Dynamics 365 had helped to emulate curiosity for development and the true work flow of an IT department. Working on .NET frameworks in Visual Studio for auotmation of unit testing deployed under Azure Devops was insightful and highly knowledge enlightening. Further had the opportunity to create customer reviews progressive web application that make use of web-scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium and JSon library modules. A keen interest for automation of data analysis was incited after being able to work with Power Automate and creating cloud flows for automated data streamlining from REST APIs to cloud-based platform Micrrosoft Sharepoint. 

As a person with high spontantous energy for various activties outside the field of IT, was able to achieve 1st place in girls chess team during the inter-university BITS Pilani Dubai sports festival of 2022-23 and Heriot Watt Sports fest of 2023. Love to read books, keep up journaling with poetries and do wacky pencil sketches from time to time. Would love to connect and make new friends here 🤓💯🙋‍♀️
